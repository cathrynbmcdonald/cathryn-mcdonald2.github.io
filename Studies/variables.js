 * VARIABLES
 * 
 * 0: Variables are named containers that we can use to store primitive values such as
 * strings, numbers, and booleans. Variables can also be used to store addresses for
 * complex values such as arrays, objects, and functions. You can declare a variable using 3 different
 *  declarative keywords (var, let, and const).
 * 
 * 1. Declaration and Assignment: To create a variable in JavaScript, it is best practice to first declare 
 * the variable using one of the 3 declarative keywords. At this point, the variable has a value of
 * undefined. Once declared, you can then assign the variable a value.
 * 
 * 2. var, let, const: Variables declared with var are globally scoped, whereas variables declared
 * with let and const are block scoped. Variables declared with var and let can be reassigned to different
 * values, but variables declared with const cannot be reassisned. Variables assigned with let should
 * be given an initial value when they are declared.
 * 
 * 3. Hoisting: Javascript hoists all function and var declarations to the top
 * of the scope they were created in, either global or function. Variables declared with let or const are
 * hoisted to the top of the code block
 *
